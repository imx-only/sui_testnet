About sui deployed

Rent a Linux server from Hezner or another provider (for example: Digital Ocean): I rented a server 8 CPU / 16 GB / 240 GB. After deploying the smart contract, we will remove the server.

We need to update the server and install the packages for Linux: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install curl
. <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecorD0/utils/main/installers/rust.sh…)
sudo apt-get install git-all
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install gcc

Install Sui binaries:
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git… --branch devnet sui

Create a new Sui wallet:
sui client active-address y enter (default) write 0 or 1 or 2 (I wrote 1)
Save Secret Recovery Phrase and note down your Sui Wallet address
Go to Sui Discord https://discord.gg/sui and send !faucet your wallet address in devnet-faucet.

Clone the Sui repository:
git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git… --branch devnet
In the root/sui/sui_programmability folder we can see examples of smart contract code.

We can publish the first smart contract on Sui:
sui client publish sui/sui_programmability/examples/move_tutorial --gas-budget 30000
We have a Transaction Hash and we can go to Sui Explorer https://explorer.sui.io/?network=devnet to make sure that the transaction was successful.

Repeat these actions for other smart contracts: sui client publish sui/sui_programmability/examples/nfts --gas-budget 30000 sui client publish sui/sui_programmability/examples/games --gas-budget 30000 etc.13749

Paste your wallet address into Sui Explorer and make sure the smart contracts are published: After that, remove the server.
